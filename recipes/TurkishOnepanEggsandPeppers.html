    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Menemen is a traditional Turkish dish that's healthy and brilliant for brunch, lunch or supper. Serve with warm pitta bread for scooping up the delicious sauce and runny egg yolks</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>2 onions, sliced</li>
        <li>1 red or green pepper, halved deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>1-2 red chillies, deseeded and sliced</li>
        <li>400g can chopped tomatoes</li>
        <li>1-2 tsp caster sugar</li>

        <li>small bunch parsley, roughly chopped</li>
        <li>6 tbsp thick, creamy yogurt</li>

    </ul> 
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a heavy-based frying pan. Stir in the onions, pepper and chillies. Cook until they begin to soften. Add the tomatoes and sugar, mixing well. Cook until the liquid has reduced, season.</li>
        <li>Using a wooden spoon, create 4 pockets in the tomato mixture and crack the eggs into them. Cover the pan and cook the eggs over a low heat until just set.</li>
        <li>Beat the yogurt with the garlic and season. Sprinkle the menemen with parsley and serve from the frying pan with a dollop of the garlic-flavoured yogurt.</li>
